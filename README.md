# Python-Programming-by-John-Zelle-3rd-edition-NOTES
Personal notes from 'Python Programming' 3rd edition by John Zelle. Many (most) of the code examples are from the book. 
All credit to the author and coders of the book where most of the examples derive from. These are personal notes, not even close to a substitute to reading the actual book.
